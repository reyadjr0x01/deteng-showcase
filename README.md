# Detection Engineering Showcase â€” Ahmed Reyad

Short intro: I'm building detections and labs to demonstrate practical detection engineering skills:
- Sigma rules, KQL (Azure Sentinel), Splunk SPL examples
- Lab writeups with screenshots / videos
- Mapping to MITRE ATT&CK and notes on tuning / false positives

## Contents
- /detections: Rules per platform
- /labs: Repro steps and evidence
- /docs: Templates and explanations

## How to use
Each detection has:
- Problem / Attack scenario
- Query / Rule
- Testing steps (how I triggered it)
- Tuning notes & MITRE ATT&CK IDs
